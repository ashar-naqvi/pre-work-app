# pre-work-app

I have added all of the xml files and java files to this github link. Note that I have not fully completed the task at hand and thus have handed in everything I managed to do. I hope we can find where I went wrong and show how I could've reached my solution.

Another thing to note is that I have a background and 6 cat images which I used in my app. These photos could be any photos of cats and the background was just a logo of a cat in a box so I suppose if you were to revuild this app, getting any 6 pictures of cats and a new background won't make any difference to the app.
